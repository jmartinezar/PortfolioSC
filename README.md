# Porfolio
## Author: Juan Sebastián Martínez Arévalo.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase the author's skills in programming and, more specifically, scientific programming, highlighting key aspects as data manipulation (processing, visualization) and automation. All directories contain, at least, a written report(done in LaTeX, unless otherwise specific) that explains the topic being treated, the necessary code to address it, and a Makefile that executes everything needed to create the report. The report creation is the default target in the Makefile. Therefore, it is sufficient to go to the directory and run the 'make' command to create it.

 - GNU Make 4.1
 - g++ 7.5.0
